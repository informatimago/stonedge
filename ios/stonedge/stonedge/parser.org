Level specification is a multiline string with the following syntax:

    level-specification ::= grid { cell-definition } .
    grid ::= { cell-line } .
    cell-line ::= { cell-char } .
    cell-char ::= '.' | ' '    --  empty-cell
                | 'S'          --  solid-cell starting position
                | 'O'          --  solid-cell
                | 'T'          --  target-cell
                | 'I'          --  ice-cell
                | 'C'          --  crumble-cell
                | other-char . --  the character is searched in the list of cell definitions.
    cell-definition ::= cell-name 'pathway' 'open'|'closed'
                      | cell-name 'red' { cell-name }
                      | cell-name 'blue' { cell-name } .
    cell-name ::= other-char . 


The characters are case insensitive.
Each cell-definition is on its own line.

'pathway' indicates the class of the cell is pathway-cell, and
the following keyword indicates its initial state.

'red' indicates the class of the cell is red-button-cell;
'blue' indicates the class of the cell is blue-button-cell; in
both cases, the rest is the list of pathway cell-names
connected to the button. This list can be given with or
without spaces between the cell-name character.

There must be a single start position, and all the non empty cells
must be at least two steps from the borders.
