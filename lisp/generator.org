Stonedge Game Description
==========================


Stonedge game is a board game with one moving token named the menhir.



The board is made of square cells of various kinds:



The menhir is a 2x1x1 paralellogram (two cubes).

When standing vertically, the menhir stands on one cell.

When standing horizontally, the menhir stands on two adjacent cells.

The menhir can be moved, by "rotating" it around one of its vertices
on the ground.



The kind of cells are:

- empty cell; nothing can stand on an empty cell; if the menhir is moved over an empty cell, it falls down and the game is lost.

- normal solid cell.

- origin cell; the menhir starts vertically on this cell.

- target cell; the menhir must arrive and stand vertically on this cell to win the game.

- ice cell; ice cells are brittle. They can support only half the weight of the menhir. If the menhir stands vertically on a ice cell, it will break and the menhir will fall down and the game is lost.

- crumble cell; once the menhir departs a crumble cell, it breaks and falls down. The menhir cannot come back to the same position.

- pathway cells; pathway cells can be open or closed. The menhir can only stand on an open pathway cell.  A closed pathway cells behaves like an empty cell. The initial state of a pathway cell can be open or closed. Button cells are used to change the state of pathway cells.

- two kinds of button cells: red button cells and blue button cells.  A red button cell is activated when the menhir lands on it vertically or horizontally.  A blue button cell is activated only when the menhir lands on it vertically.  A button cells can switch the state of multiple specific pathway cells.



To simplify computing the position of the menhir on the board, we can
assume that there are at least two rows or columns of empty cells
around the board.

 

The user is presented with a board with the menhir standing vertically
on the origin cell.

He gives one by one a series of movements for the menhir (left, right,
front, back) to reach the target cell.

The program must display the cells and the menhir in an orthographic
projection, animate the rotation of the menhir for each movement, and
compute whether the menhir lands on a valid position, a losing
position or a winning position.

Each kind of cell is drawn in a specific and distinct way (depending
on the kind and state of the cell).

When landing on a losing position, an animation of the menhir falling
down is show and the game is lost.



Stonedge Solver Description
===========================


There is a solver program for the stonedge game.

The solver takes a game description (board cells and menhir position),
and compute a solution (a path of menhir movements) if possible.

This is done by exploring a tree of possible movements until reaching
the target cell in vertical position.



Note that the presence of crumble cells, and pathway cells with two
states implies that a solution can be thought of as a tree of subgoals
(to walk a path to some subgoal cell or the target cell), we may need
to have activated a button, so we may have the subgoal of reaching
this button (in the right position) first.

Stonedge Game Generator Description
===================================

We want to generate random stonedge games.

The random generator must produce a description of the board (cells
positions, cell types, pathway cells states, button cells
connections).

The Stonedge Solver can be used to validate the generated game and
ensure that a solution exist.

To ensure that the generated games are interesting problems, the
generator may use a subgoal approach:

- generate a list of random subgoals (open a given pathway cell, or arrive
  on a cell vertically or horizontally in one direction or the other
  direction). 

- for each subgoal, generate a path (list of movement steps)
  allocating cells in the board to support the movement.
  Pathway cells and button cells are generated at the ends of the path
  as required.

- paths may (and should cross one another to avoid generating too many
  cells),

- crumble cells and ice cells can be added (or replace solid cells) as
  long as the Solver still validates that a solution is possible. (A
  crumbler cell ensures that a given path can be travelled only once.
  Ice cells ensure that the menhir must be horizontal over them, etc).


Stonedge Game Description Format
================================

A Stonedge Game is given in Common Lisp as a list containing a
multiline string containing the board schema.  This string contains:
- a dot or whitespace for an empty cell.
- 'S' for the origin cell.
- 'T' for the target cell.
- 'O' for solid cells.
- 'I' for ice cells.
- 'C' for crumble cells.
other characters name button or pathway cells.
The string is followed by clauses describing the
button or pathway cells:
- (bname :blue|:red pname…) for a button cell,
- (pname :pathway :open|:closed) for a pathway cell.
bname or pname are 1-letter (case insensitive) symbols, the character
being used in the string to indicate the position of the cell.
