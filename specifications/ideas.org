* Ideas for next version

** Portail cells.

A pair of portail cells let the menhir be teleported from one to the other.
This would allow to skip to discontinued grids.

** 3D levels

A level could have several boards one above the other.
We could pass from one board to the other thru an elevator cell. (A kind of portail cell).

If the block falls down only one floor, it could survive on the board below.
